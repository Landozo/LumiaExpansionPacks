# LumiaExpansionPacks  
The Home of the Expansion Packs I made for Prolix's Excellent Lucid Loom Preset.  

You can find Lucid Loom at Prolix's Site Here:

Lumia personality packs will be using Prolix's new [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper) extension!

Author Packs and Lumia packs can both be downloaded from there!

Check out Jun's lovely Lumias at well on her github [here](https://github.com/sakanomichi/LumiaDLC)!

2. Grab a json (preferably the one with the biggest numbers!)
3. Import it into [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper), NOT into sillytavern (you can to see the defs, but you want it off in Sillytavern, only on in the extension)
4. Make sure you have the custom toggles in Lucid Loom 3.0 beta 7+ toggled (One in lumia definitions and one in lumia personality)
