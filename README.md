# LumiaExpansionPacks  
The Home of the Expansion Packs I made for Prolix's Excellent Lucid Loom Preset.  

You can find Lucid Loom at Prolix's Site Here:

Will be using the lorebook injection method (Thanks to Eleisea for working this all out!)  

## How to install final releases:

1. Head over to Prolix's site
2. Download the lorebook
3. Import the lorebook
4. Enable the toggles you want
5. ???
6. Profit!

## How to install beta releases of Lumia Personalities:
1. Go to the [Personality Packs](PersonalityPacks) folder.
2. Grab a json (preferably the one with the biggest numbers!)
3. Import it into [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper), NOT into sillytavern (you can to see the defs, but you want it off in Sillytavern, only on in the extension)
4. Make sure you have the custom toggles in Lucid Loom 3.0 beta 7+ toggled (One in lumia definitions and one in lumia personality)
5. Mix and match however you want in the Lumia helper injection extension!
6. Give me feedback in the channel please!

## How to install beta releases of Lumia Author Packs:
1. Go to the [Author Packs](AuthorPacks) folder.
2. Grab a json (Preferably the one with the biggest numbers)
3. Import it into Sillytavern (like a normal lorebook)
4. In Lucid Loom v3.0 beta 7, go to the presets and create a new toggle under user instructions.
5. In that instruction, simply put {{outlet:Lumia_Retrofit}}
